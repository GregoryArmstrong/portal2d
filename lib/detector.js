// need to limit collision detection to only realistic collisions. If a block is on the bottom of the screen,
// why check for collisions of the bottom or sides of the block? Perhaps each block has a attribute of some kind which lists which sides
// are able to be collided with? Each block is then checked for which side is collideable, if what is colliding with it makes sense, and then
// verifies that mathematically.
// For projectiles, if theyre traveling in x+ direction, only collisions on the left side of blocks should be checked. For x- projectiles,
// only the right side, etc.

//           |__| = 3           /| bullet = 3, \/ bullet = 1
